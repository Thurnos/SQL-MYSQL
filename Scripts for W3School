???JOINS

1.Inner Join
Returns only the rows where there is a match in both tables based on the 
specified condition.

2.Left Join
Returns all rows from the left table (table1), and the matched rows from the 
right table (table2). If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns 
from the right table.

3.Right Join
Returns all rows from the right table (table2), and the matched rows from the 
left table (table1). If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns 
from the left table.

4.Full Join
Returns all rows when there is a match in either the left or right table. 
If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the table without 
a match.

SELECT 
    o.OrderID, 
    c.CustomerName, 
    s.ShipperName
FROM 
    (Orders AS o
    INNER JOIN Customers AS c 
    ON o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID)
    INNER JOIN Shippers AS s 
    ON o.ShipperID = s.ShipperID;
    
    
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName, Shippers.ShipperName
FROM ((Orders
INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID)
INNER JOIN Shippers ON Orders.ShipperID = Shippers.ShipperID); 



WHEN JOINING TABLES WE CAN REFER TO THEM AS OBJECTS LIKE 

SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
FROM employees AS e
INNER JOIN departments AS d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;




SELECT TOP 4 * 
FROM Products
WHERE ProductID > 20 
  AND ProductName  NOT LIKE '%a' -> '%a' return anything that ends with letter a
  AND ProductName NOT LIKE 'G%' -> 'G%' return anything that starts with letter G
ORDER BY SupplierID DESC;

Difference between select top 4 and limit 4 is that limit 4 will return only 4 rows of the table
where TOP will return the first 4 rows that match the condition we have


SELECT LastName as Name , EmployeeID
FROM Employees
WHERE LastName NOT LIKE '%A%' and LastName LIKE '%L%';
%A% is a WildCard so it means select any name without a's inside 
and %L% is selecting any name that has any l's in it



SELECT City, MIN(CustomerName) AS Name
FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName NOT LIKE 'A%' AND City LIKE '%L%'
GROUP BY City
ORDER BY City;

Selecting Names that dont start with A and cities that dont have any L's in them
GROUP BY sorts all of the city names to ensure there wont be more than one entry 
for the same city name and then we sort them alpabetically 


SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE ProductID BETWEEN 10 AND 21
AND Price IN (10,20,30);

SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE ProductName BETWEEN "Carnarvon Tigers" AND "Chef Anton's Cajun Seasoning"
ORDER BY ProductName;


SELECT CustomerName, Address + ', ' + PostalCode + ' ' + City + ', ' + Country AS Address
FROM Customers; 
->Concatenate Address , postalcode , city and coutry together into a single table


SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country
HAVING COUNT (CustomerID) > 4;

Selects the count of people for each country
